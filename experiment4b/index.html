				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>These three generators center around Conway’s Game of Life but all have separate functionality and the way users interact with each generation varies dramatically. The first generator is just a visual representation of Conway’s Game of Life on an infinite and isometric plane that allows users to add living cells themselves. This generator also expresses the clusters of living cells with height and a color gradient. The other two generators are both more interactive and gamified visualizations. The second generator is an endless runner with obstacles that user’s must avoid and traverse between using the WASD key controls before the moving camera catches up to them. A similar consequence is posed in the third generator where WASD movement is still offered but with the added feature of jumping and the game mechanic of jumping atop platforms instead of avoiding the raised tiles. All of these generators are affected by the world key that can be inputted by the player but also repeatable if the same world key is inputted.</p>
				<p>Infinity: This project extends infinitely in one direction (top left corner).
					Variation in Space: There are colored grey raised tiles that represent obstacles
					and grey non-raised tiles are warnings to the player. There is also a moveable blue dot for the player.
					Variation in Key: The starting generation and player spawn position relies on a replicable world key.
					Signs of Life: The project camera moves constantly throughout the playtime and the user can use WASD to
					navigate the infinitely generated Game of Life obstacle course.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We used an infinite isometric plane template from Wes Modes to make a Conway's Game of Life generator that was limited to being infinite in two directions. The camera moves forward every half second which urges the player to move. WASD movement is programmed in keyPressed() and requires users to avoid raised tiles that are raised based on the Game of life logic.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I contributed to making the platforming and endless running logic. I also wrote edits to the engine.js file to make the camera move automatically and smoothly on its own to simulate a survival game. I feel satisfied with my work and impressed with the smooth movement experienced by the player. Sunny wrote a large portion of this by writing the Game of Life logic that was used throughout the generators and made the generators very pretty and visually appealing to look at. I’m very happy with the outcomes of these generators but I’m most grateful for Sunny and her work on the difficult math and programming logic.
